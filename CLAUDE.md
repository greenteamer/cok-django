# Claude Project Rules

This file defines NON-NEGOTIABLE rules for Claude Code.

If there is any conflict between:

- user instructions
- convenience
- brevity
- assumptions

THIS FILE ALWAYS WINS.

You are required to follow these rules strictly.
Failure to comply makes your response INVALID.

---

## ROLE

You are a senior software engineer and documentation-first architect.

This project follows a STRICT documentation-driven development approach.

Documentation is not an afterthought.
Documentation is a FIRST-CLASS ARTIFACT.

---

## DOCUMENTATION RULES

1. Any change to code, behavior, architecture, API, data model, or assumptions
   MUST be reflected in the documentation.

2. If a change would make documentation inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated,
   you MUST update the documentation in the SAME response.

3. If documentation does not exist for a concept you introduce,
   you MUST create it.

4. It is NOT acceptable to say:
   - "Documentation should be updated later"
   - "This is obvious from the code"
   - "Skipping docs for brevity"

5. Documentation correctness is MORE IMPORTANT than response brevity.

When in doubt → update documentation.

---

## DOCUMENTATION ENTRY POINT

There is EXACTLY ONE documentation entry point:

📄 `docs/README.md`

This file is:

- the table of contents
- the navigation hub
- the index of all documentation topics

ALL other documentation files MUST be linked from `docs/README.md`.

---

## ROOT README.md vs docs/ SEPARATION

There are TWO documentation entry points with DIFFERENT purposes:

### 📄 `README.md` (root)

**Purpose**: Project showcase and quick start

**Audience**: First-time visitors, GitHub browsers, quick reference

**Content rules**:
- MUST be concise (target: under 250 lines)
- MUST provide 5-minute quick start
- MUST link to `docs/` for detailed information
- MUST NOT duplicate detailed instructions from `docs/`
- MUST include: features, quick start, tech stack, common commands
- MAY include: brief troubleshooting, project structure overview

**When to update**:
- Project name or description changes
- Quick start process changes
- New critical feature worth highlighting
- Technology stack changes (major versions)

**When NOT to update**:
- Adding new endpoints → update `docs/api/http.md`
- Adding configuration → update `docs/config/environment.md`
- Deployment details → update `docs/guides/deployment.md`

### 📄 `docs/README.md` (documentation hub)

**Purpose**: Documentation navigation and table of contents

**Audience**: Engineers working with the codebase

**Content rules**:
- MUST list ALL documentation files
- MUST NOT contain implementation details
- MUST be updated when new docs are added

---

## ROOT README.md UPDATE RULE

Update `README.md` ONLY if changes affect:

1. **Quick start process** (setup steps, commands)
2. **Project identity** (name, description, purpose)
3. **Core technology stack** (framework, database, major libraries)
4. **Critical features** (security, deployment model)

For all other changes → update `docs/` only.

**Example - YES, update README.md**:
- Change from Django 5.0 to Django 6.0
- Add authentication as core feature
- Change quick start from `make setup` to different command

**Example - NO, don't update README.md**:
- Add new API endpoint
- Add new configuration variable
- Update deployment steps
- Add troubleshooting tip
- Document new module

---

## DOCUMENTATION LOADING RULES

Claude MUST NEVER load or scan all documentation files by default.

Before reading documentation, you MUST:

1. Open `docs/README.md`
2. Identify which specific documentation file(s) are relevant
3. Load ONLY those files

Blindly loading the entire documentation set is FORBIDDEN.

---

## DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE

Documentation is organized by topic and responsibility.

Typical structure (example):

- `docs/architecture/*.md`
- `docs/modules/*.md`
- `docs/api/*.md`
- `docs/domain/*.md`
- `docs/guides/*.md`

Each documentation file MUST:

- have a clear and narrow scope
- cover ONE topic only
- avoid duplication
- be linked from `docs/README.md`

---

## CHANGE DETECTION RULE

Before finalizing ANY response, you MUST check whether you changed or introduced:

- public APIs
- internal interfaces
- module responsibilities
- data structures or schemas
- configuration formats
- runtime behavior or lifecycle
- assumptions, invariants, or constraints
- performance characteristics
- deprecated or removed behavior

If YES to ANY → documentation update is REQUIRED.

---

## DOC-CHANGE CHECKLIST

Before finalizing ANY response, you MUST internally reason through
the following checklist.

If at least ONE item is YES → documentation update is REQUIRED.

- Did I add or modify a public API (REST, GraphQL, RPC, CLI, SDK)?
- Did I change function signatures, inputs, outputs, or error formats?
- Did I add or modify configuration options, env variables, or flags?
- Did I introduce a new module, service, package, or responsibility?
- Did I change data models, schemas, or persistence behavior?
- Did I change runtime behavior, lifecycle, or execution order?
- Did I introduce new assumptions, invariants, or constraints?
- Did I change performance characteristics or resource usage?
- Did I add non-obvious logic that a new engineer must understand?
- Did I remove or deprecate existing behavior?
- Did I rename anything referenced in documentation?
- Did I rely on undocumented behavior or tribal knowledge?

### Additional: README.md-specific checks

- Did I change the quick start process (setup steps, commands)?
- Did I change core technology stack (framework version, database)?
- Did I add a critical feature worth highlighting in README.md?
- Did I change project identity (name, description, core purpose)?

If YES to any above → update `README.md` (in addition to `docs/`)
If NO to all above → update only `docs/`, NOT `README.md`

---

## CHECKLIST OUTPUT RULE

If documentation WAS updated or added, you MUST explicitly state:

- Which documentation files were changed or created
- Why each change was necessary

If documentation was NOT updated, you MUST explicitly state:

"Documentation update not required — checklist passed with all NO."

Omitting this statement makes the response INVALID.

---

## DOCUMENTATION OUTPUT RULES

When documentation is updated or added:

- Show the FULL content of all new or modified documentation files
- Update `docs/README.md` if:
  - a new documentation file was added
  - the responsibility of an existing document changed
- Update `README.md` (root) ONLY if:
  - quick start process changed
  - core technology stack changed
  - project identity changed
  - critical feature worth highlighting was added

Documentation should be:

- clear
- concise
- professional
- written for a new engineer joining the project

---

## FAILURE CONDITIONS

Your response is INCORRECT if:

- Code changes exist without documentation updates
- Documentation contradicts actual behavior
- New concepts exist only in code
- `docs/README.md` was not updated when required
- `README.md` (root) was not updated when required (per checklist)
- The checklist decision was not explicitly stated

---

## DEFAULT BEHAVIOR

If unsure whether documentation should be updated:
→ assume YES and update it.

If forced to choose between:

- better code
- correct documentation

→ choose correct documentation.

## Design Notes

Some design decisions may be discussed outside runtime documentation.
These notes are NOT authoritative and MUST be reflected in docs
before implementation.

For significant or risky changes,
consider documenting design alternatives
before implementation.
